# Workout Tracker

This project is a **Workout Tracker** web application that allows users to track their exercise repetitions, time per exercise, and overall workout duration. The user can add exercises, specify the number of repetitions and time allotted for each, and monitor their progress in real-time. 

## Features
- **Track Exercises**: Users can input exercises with the number of repetitions and the time duration required.
- **Timer per Exercise**: Each exercise can be started, paused, and completed, with a timer showing the remaining time.
- **Total Time Tracker**: The total workout time is tracked and displayed.
- **Exercise Management**: Users can add new exercises, start/pause them, mark them as completed, and start the next exercise after a break.
- **Workout Summary**: After completing all exercises, a summary is displayed showing the actual time spent versus the allotted time for each exercise.
- **Local Storage**: The workout data is saved in the browserâ€™s local storage, so progress is retained even after refreshing the page.

## Project Structure
- **HTML**: Basic structure of the page with input fields, buttons, and a display section for tracking exercises.
- **CSS**: Provides styling for the UI elements.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the core functionality like starting, pausing, resuming, and stopping timers, as well as updating the UI.

## Key Functions
- **addex()**: Adds a new exercise to the list with the given repetitions and time.
- **renderex()**: Renders the list of exercises dynamically, showing the current state of each exercise.
- **startex() / stopex()**: Starts or stops the timer for a specific exercise.
- **completeex()**: Marks an exercise as complete and automatically starts the next one after a delay.
- **startTotalTimer() / updateTotalTime()**: Manages the total workout time and updates the display.
- **startnextex() / nextex()**: Automatically starts the next exercise after a break period.
- **showsummary()**: Displays a summary table at the end of the workout with details of each exercise.
- **saveToLocalStorage() / init()**: Saves and loads the exercise data and workout status from local storage.
