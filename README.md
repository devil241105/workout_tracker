# Bug Fixes for Workout Timer Code

This document describes the changes made to the workout timer code to resolve issues with the main timer continuing to run even when exercises are paused.

## Issue: Main Timer Not Stopping When Pausing an Exercise

The main workout timer (`totalTime`) was running continuously, even when individual exercises were paused. This issue occurred because the total timer was not being paused when all exercises were paused. Additionally, the logic only affected the individual exercise timers (`actualTime`) but not the overall workout timer.

## Solution

### 1. Modify `stopex` to Pause the Total Timer

We updated the `stopex()` function, which pauses an individual exercise, to also pause the total workout timer if no exercises are running. 

```javascript
function stopex(index) {
    if (index < 0 || index >= exercises.length) {
        console.error(\`Invalid exercise index: \${index}\`);
        return;
    }
    const exercise = exercises[index];
    exercise.isRunning = false;
    clearInterval(exercise.timer);
    exercise.timer = null;

    // Check if no exercises are running
    if (!exercises.some(ex => ex.isRunning)) {
        clearInterval(totalTimer); // Pause the total workout timer if no exercise is running
        totalTimer = null;
    }

    renderex();
    saveToLocalStorage();
}
